On September 9, 2023 the Reddit user [Real-Twice](https://old.reddit.com/user/Real-Twice) [submitted a post](https://old.reddit.com/r/solarpunk/comments/16e2jyx/what_is_the_definitive_solarpunk_work_of_fiction/) asking:

> What Is the definitive solarpunk work of fiction?

There were nearly 100 replies in the comments with many good suggestions.
Since I wanted to read several of the titles suggested, I collected all of the suggestions into a text file.
Once I was done, I realized it was a pretty good list and I wanted to share it.

What does it mean for a movement when someone must ask what the definitive works are?
For one, we must be pretty early if basic questions like this are unanswered.
It seemed like this particular question was answered really well by the community and I wanted to write it down for posterity.
After all, if this is a basic question, then it is going to be asked frequently.

I also want to acknowledge [the fantastic Solarpunk book list](https://best-sci-fi-books.com/16-best-solarpunk-books/) compiled by Dan Livingston.

Finally, the Reddit Solarpunk community maintains [a list of Solarpunk Fiction](https://old.reddit.com/r/solarpunk/wiki/media/books_fiction).
