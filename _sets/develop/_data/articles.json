    "abstract": "The pathogenesis of Parker's Rat Coronavirus (PRCV) was studied in axenic CD rats. Three to four 9 to 10 week old rats were euthanized daily for eight days after intranasal inoculation. Rats remained free of clinical disease. Virus was recovered from the nasopharynx and trachea after twenty-four hours and from the lung by day three but was not detected in respiratory tract after seven days. Viral antigen was detected by indirect immunofluorescence in the mucosal epithelium of upper respiratory tract and in pulmonary alveolar septae from day two to six postinoculation. Acute rhinitis developed by day two and was associated with mild focal necrosis of respiratory mucosal epithelium. Mild nonsuppurative tracheitis and multifocal interstitial pneumonia appeared by day five and persisted through day eight. Dacryoadenitis did not occur, sialoadenitis was detected in only three rats and virus was recovered from only one submaxillary salivary gland. This experiment indicates that PRCV can be a primary pathogen for the respiratory system of adult rats. In contrast to sialodacryoadenitis (SDA) virus the tropism of PRCV for salivary and lacrimal glands is low. ",

The virus multiplies only in human tissue culture systems, but a variety of cell types are sensitive to it. The virus has been isolated in three continuous cell lines and a plaque assay has been developed in one of these. This cell line (L 132) derived from human embryo lung, was also used to isolate three other viruses of similar morphology which had previously been cultivated only in organ cultures of human respiratory epithelium. High rates of isolation of these viruses were made in L 132 cells using nasal washings from experimentally inoculated volunteers. It is concluded that this cell line is a valuable tool in the study of viruses of this group. ",

Several members of this group of human and animal pathogens are shown to cross-react in one or more type of test, but one member, avian infectious bronchitis virus, was shown to be unrelated. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV3) was found to be antigenically related to a number of human types of coronavirus.

In early passages of the British coronavirus, particles of about 30 nm in diameter were observed in the faeces by electron microscopy. These particles were removed from the coronavirus preparations by cross-protection experiments in calves.

When they are grown in the presence of serum, the thermal inactivation rate of OC43, and the UV inactivation rate of both OC43 and 229E are reduced, and evidence suggests this is because the viruses are in aggregates.
